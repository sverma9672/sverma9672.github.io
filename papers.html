          1. Resource Allocation for Efficient IOT Application in Fog Computing
        </button>
        <div id="research1" class="collapse p-2" style="background-color: white;">
          <p>
            When we come across problems in creating IOT architecture the major
            problem that arises is automatic stipulation of resources. At the
            same time in today’s era it’s very important to integrate this
            problem with better Quality of Services (QoS) because of which the
            cloud computing is taking a shift. As we are well acquainted that in
            fog computing networks bandwidth is limited therefore it becomes
            quite important to build a joint architecture with resource
            allocation problem giving it a better quality of services with
            enhanced efficiency and low latency communication. Priority of QoS
            is determined by Systematic Ladder Process (SLP) and decision
            parameter evaluation by RECK algorithm. In this paper we will design
            a better framework for IOT resource Allocation Scheme with better
            efficiency and better QoS. The paper too highlights the comparison
            of the previous works of the resource allocation algorithms and
            schemes with RECK algorithm.

          <p>
            The walls of this paper lie upon two strong building Components in
            context of IOT forensics – The first lays stress upon XYZ Region
            Model that might be co-relating the Digital Forensics. The second
            finds the best suitable Concept that might be integrated in the use
            with XYZ model. The above two components play a vital role in the
            identification, collection of clues or the evidences of suspects in
            security attacks and the storage of these evidences . IOT forensics
            is too a science that involves the systematic knowledge gained by
            human being through experimentation, Observation, Processing of the
            facts and coming to a effective conclusion. The paper too gives a
            brief distinction of IOT Forensics (IOTF) with Digital Forensics
            (DF). These two components enhance the efficiency of the security
            models and maximizing the of the given time and assure us the
            perfect evidence recognition and data extraction. These concepts can
            be interlinked with many frameworks , models . Keywords : Internet

          <p class="mt-1">Keeping in mind the aspect of IOT in which we had long computations of online parameter lists and outcome that came out from IOT devices, this paper is written to design a scheme in which there is multiplicity in the parameter lists based on αβ algorithm. The processing of parameters, Collection of parameters, processing of parameters and displaying it done by the layer which senses it with the help of Transmitting network layer in combination with application layer. αβ neural network algorithm is integrated with the application layer in order to provide the optimisation of real parameters and to reduce the computations of parameters and provide enhanced accurate estimation and prediction. The theme is completely based on gathering environment related data. This algorithm using 3 layers has a unique property for providing the estimation and approximation of the non linear curves and can predict the best temperature pattern, the experimental results too believe in the same. There is an online simulation of this computation scheme based on the same algorithm and to enhance the speed of data gathering per unit time, prediction of environment data and alarming us the warning to hazards.  As the improvement is the part of technology development in the same way we have shown the improvement in αβ algorithm by the use of Population Depending stochastic Algorithm being in the domain of artificial intelligence. Being an evolutionary computation the variation in the velocity of entities around these parameters by several methods results in enhancement of the efficiency of the current algorithm.

        4.Human Recognition Subjected to Eye Movement Biometrics and</br> Proposal Of Hybrid Algorithm depending upon Heterogenous <br> Information Sources For Eye Movement based Human Identification.        </button>
        <div id="research4" class="collapse p-2" style="background-color: white;">
          <p class="mt-1">This paper presents a research for the use of multi-source information fusion in the field of eye movement biometrics. In the current state-of-the-art, there are different techniques developed to extract the physical and the behavioural biometric characteristics of the eye movements. In this work, we explore the effects from the multi-source fusion of the heterogeneous information extracted by different biometric algorithms under the presence of diverse visual stimuli. We propose a two-stage fusion approach with the employment of stimulus-specific and algorithm-specific weights for fusing the information from different matchers based on their identification efficacy. The experimental evaluation performed on a large database of 320 subjects reveals a considerable improvement in biometric recognition accuracy, with minimal equal error rate (EER) of 5.8%, and best case Rank-1 identification rate (Rank-1 IR) of 88.6%. It should be also emphasized that although the concept of multi-stimulus fusion is currently evaluated specifically for the eye movement biometrics, it can be adopted by other biometric modalities too, in cases when an exogenous stimulus affects the extraction of the biometric features. 
            The contribution of the current research in the field of eye movement biometrics can be summarized as follows: 	
            1) We introduce the concept of heterogenous sourced information fused algorithm, i.e. fusion of different instances of the same modality (eye movements) under the influence of different visual stimuli. 
            2) We propose a step by step weighted fusion scheme for the efficient combination of the comparison scores generated by the different eye movement algorithms (hybrid-algorithmic fusion) under the influence of diverse visual stimuli. Also, we suggest a weight-training method for the calculation of the fusion weights. 
            3) We fuse the 4 eye movement algorithms : OPC , CEM-B, FDM , WAVELET which are suitable for multi stimulus.
